# Session 1:  Computer Vision and Deep Learning

## Welcome
Begins with a welcome message from Sebastian Thrun before introducing the 
nanodegree instructors, .... and ....  An overview of the nanodegree is given,
then a short synopsis of each project that we will work on, followed by a word
about available career and nanodegree support.

Course deadline policy is addressed: 

The section ends with a brief history of self-driving cars, the "Great Robot Race,"
and a quiz (to make sure you're not a dummy).
