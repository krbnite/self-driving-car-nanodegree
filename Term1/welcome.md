## Welcome


### Synopsis
Begins with a welcome message from [Sebastian Thrun](http://robots.stanford.edu/)
before introducing the nanodegree instructors, 
[David Silver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsilver829/) 
(who worked at Ford as a self-driving car engineer)
and [Ryan Keenan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-keenan-980759a6/)
(an astrophysict).
An overview of the nanodegree is given, then a short synopsis of each project that we 
will work on, followed by a word about available career and nanodegree support.

Course deadline policy is addressed:
* Suggested Project Deadlines: these are just to keep you on track
  - no penalty for missing these deadlines
  - can submit project as many times as necessary (Pro Tip: do it right the first time :-p)
* Actual Project Deadline: everything is due by last day of term
  - may request one 4-week extension

The section ends with a brief history of self-driving cars, the "Great Robot Race," and a quiz 
(to make sure you're not a dummy).



### Some Course Materials
* The [Forums](https://discussions.udacity.com/)
  - This link seems to take me to the Deep Learning Nanodegree forums... 
  - Not sure there are SDC forums... Can't find them right now.
* The [Slack Channel]()
* [Term1 Curriculum](https://medium.com/self-driving-cars/term-1-in-depth-on-udacitys-self-driving-car-curriculum-ffcf46af0c08)



### Some Background
Two major approaches to SDCs: the classical robotics approach, which fuses the output from 
a suite of sensors monitoring its environment and acts upon these stimuli in a progammatic way, 
and a more recent deep learning approach, which focuses
on training the car to drive by mimicking human behavior (i.e., using the sensor fusion output
as input to a deep net targeting the coinciding actions of a human driver).

### Major Players in the Game

### Some Potentially Helpful and/or Related Udacity Courses
These are not listed in the "Welcome" section, but I figured I'd include them here for reference.

* [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170)
  - refresher on NumPy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib if you need it (though there are probably more efficient ways to do that)
* [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)
  - Naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees
* [Segmentation and Clustering](https://www.udacity.com/course/segmentation-and-clustering--ud981)
  - this is an Alteryx/Tabluea sponsored course
  - you're better off learning the concepts and figuring out how to implement in python or R
* [Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-unsupervised-learning--ud741)
* [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)
* [Introduction to Computer Vision](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810)
