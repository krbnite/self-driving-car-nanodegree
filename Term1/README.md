### Rubric
Each project comes with a rubric detailing the requirements for passing the project. 
Project reviewers will check your project against the rubric to make sure that it 
meets specifications.

### Code
Each project has specific instructions about 
what files are required. Make sure that your code is commented and easy for the project reviewers 
to follow. For  Jupyter notebooks, run all of the code cells, export the notebook 
as an HTML file, and include both files. 

### Writeup
All of the projects in Term 1 require a writeup. The writeup is your chance to explain how you 
approached the project. It is also an opportunity to show your understanding of key concepts 
in the program.

### Submission
When submitting a project, you can either submit it as a link to a GitHub repository or as a 
ZIP file. When submitting a GitHub repository, we advise creating a new repository, specific 
to the project you are submitting.
