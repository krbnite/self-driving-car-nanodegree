## Job Search Strategies
### 1. Conduct a Job Search
Some of the advice is obvious, but some of it is worth emphasizing.  
For example, a job search can be highly stressful.  It is important to not apply 
to just any company: each application and interview process will take quite a bit of
time and energy from you.  It is important that you do not burn out.

* Know what you want
  - many roles will look like a decent fit, but if you write down some specifics, only few will really fit
  - have 2-3 things you won't compromise on (e.g., commute time, remote work potential, etc)
* Research the company; understand what the employer wants
  - technical proficiency is just one thing a company is looking for
  - have you worked on international teams? 
  - have you managed junior team mates in addition to your technical responsibilities?
  - be prepared/knowledgeable/excited: in the interview, you will be asked, "Why do you want to work at X?" 
    * this is especially important if you are applying for a role that you really want, but do not have a lot of experience in
* Be open to opportunity

### 2. Refine Your Resume
* they talk about the 1-page resume, but I've found this is "old hat"
  - ah, but later one they talk about if you have years of experience, it's ok
* provide evidence that you are job-ready
* prior jobs: chronological vs relevance
  - the most relevant stuff you've done is pretty important!
* skills section: a short-ish list summarizing things you've picked up along the way
  - obvious skills should be left off, e.g., MSWord
* soft skills: don't list 'em, but imply 'em
  - your bullet points covering prior jobs should have things that show you're a team player, self-starter, etc
* Descriptions of Work Experiences:
  - Begin bullet points w/ action verbs: Can you complete work assignments, multitask, and deliver results?
  - Whenever possible, describe your work/results quantitatively 
    * increased profits by a factor of 3, instead of increased profits
    * lead a team of 10 people, instead of lead a team
  - Demonstrate success
    * trying something and learning something new
    * increasing efficiency
  - After bullets have been written, make sure each one portrays actions, quantitative description, and success


## Networking
### 1. Develop Your Personal Brand
Have a great online presence, and don't pass up meet-and-greets.

Have a great elevator pictch, dummy!  But not just one: have one for various types of questions.
* Tell me about yourself (trim the fat; keep only professionally relevant components)

NOTE TO SELF:  Watch this stuff again.
